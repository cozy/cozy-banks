## How to start developing

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn watch:browser # to dev
$ yarn build:browser # to build
```

When watching, you still need to have a cozy-stack running to serve the files of the app (do not use the webpack-dev-server directly). This is important as the stack injects through template variables the *token* and *domain* used to connect to the cozy. See [how to run a cozy application](https://docs.cozy.io/en/howTos/dev/runCozyDocker/#ephemeral-instance) for more information.

⚠️ CSPs must be disabled when working with the development server (as the `index.html` is served via the stack but the JS assets are served via webpack-dev-server). You can do this via a browser extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-content-security/ieelmcmcagommplceebfedjlakkhpden)) or you can tell the stack to disable CSPs via its config file (`disable_csp: true`, check here for [more info](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/config/#main-configuration-file) on the config file). See an example config file [here](https://github.com/CPatchane/create-cozy-app/blob/8329c7161a400119076a7e2734191607437f0dcc/packages/cozy-scripts/stack/disableCSP.yaml#L6). 

## Components

Check out the documentation for components on [Styleguidist](https://ptbrowne.github.io/cozy-bank/).

## Fixtures

You can add fixtures by using [ACH](https://github.com/cozy/ACH) and data in [test/fixtures](./test/fixtures).

## Skins

The Banks application can be "skinned" to MesInfos style.

Use `env SKIN='mesinfos' yarn build` for example to build with the MesInfos icon and slug. To deploy to a branch different from build you can use `env DEPLOY_BRANCH='build-maif' yarn deploy`.

You can use `scripts/build-deploy-skins` to automatically build and deploy
the vanilla app and the skinned version of the app.

## Doctypes

The doctypes used in Banks are described in the [cozy-doctypes](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes/blob/master/docs/io.cozy.bank.md) repository.

## Build

The application is built automatically and published on [Cozy Registry](https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/banks/registry) by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/cozy/cozy-banks).

The skins are also built into `build-$skin` or `latest-$skin`.
