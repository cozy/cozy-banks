## Feature requests

We love getting feedback, do not hesitate if you have any. Please use the [forum](https://forum.cozy.io/c/francais/banque) for any feature requests.

## Developing

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn watch:browser # to dev
$ yarn build:browser # to build
```

When watching, you still need to have a cozy-stack running to serve the files of the app (do not use the webpack-dev-server directly). This is important as the stack injects through template variables the *token* and *domain* used to connect to the cozy. See [how to run a cozy application](https://docs.cozy.io/en/howTos/dev/runCozyDocker/#ephemeral-instance) for more information.

⚠️ CSPs must be disabled when working with the development server (as the `index.html` is served via the stack but the JS assets are served via webpack-dev-server). You can do this via a browser extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-content-security/ieelmcmcagommplceebfedjlakkhpden)) or you can tell the stack to disable CSPs via its config file (`disable_csp: true`, check here for [more info](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/config/#main-configuration-file) on the config file). See an example config file [here](https://github.com/CPatchane/create-cozy-app/blob/8329c7161a400119076a7e2734191607437f0dcc/packages/cozy-scripts/stack/disableCSP.yaml#L6).
